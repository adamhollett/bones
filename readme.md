# Bones

[CSS](bones.css) Â· [Github](https://github.com/adamhollett/bones)

**Bones** is a tiny bit of CSS that you can add as a starting point for all your projects. It includes only the things that you'll probably want on every site.

What you get:

- CSS variables for scaling, spacing, and default font stacks
- responsive images and videos that won't outscale their containers
- a modular typography grid
- a basic flexbox grid system

...and that's all!
