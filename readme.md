# Bones

[CSS](bones.css) Â· [Github](https://github.com/adamhollett/bones)

**Bones** is a tiny bit of CSS that you can add as a starting point for all your projects. It includes only the things that you'll probably want on every site. It looks like this.

What you get:

- CSS variables for spacing, scaling, and default font stacks
- a modular typographic grid
- responsive images and videos that won't outscale their containers

...and that's all!
